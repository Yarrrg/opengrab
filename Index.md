# CURRENT STATUS AS OF JAN 20 #

We´ve had a few delays with importation regulations here in Nicaragua but everything is now either in customs awaiting authorization or on it´s way to customs. It looks like the first units will be ready for shipping the first week in March unless we encounter major screwups.
